# OpenFOAM tutorials

The tutorials related to these OpenFOAM examples are gathered in the book entitled **Numerical Simulation of heat and fluid flow using OpenFOAM**.
The book was written at first for OpenFOAM.3.0, but the examples are updated with new versions of OpenFOAM. The book is writen in Persian, but maybe
in future I translate it to English.
Any update about the book will be announced in [http://nimasamkhaniani.ir]


The OpenFOAM examples available in this repository are:

* Incompressible flow in 2D channel with cavity (icoFoam)
* Bubble rising in axisymmetric domain (interFoam)
* Heat transfer in mixing elbow (buoyantBoussinesqSimpleFoam, buoyantSimpleFoam)
* Conjugate heat transfer (chtMultiRegionFoam)
* Steady flow around the propeller (simpleFoam)
* Heated cavity (icoFoam + energy equation)
* Stepped spillway (interFoam)
* Simulation of gas flow and speicies transport in non-premixed combustion (reactingFoam)
* Simulation of turbulence in premixed combustion usig LES (XiFoam)
* Wind Flow around building (simpleFoam)
* Particle flow in cyclone (DPMFoam, MPPICFoam)
